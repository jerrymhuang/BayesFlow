BayesFlow is a Python library for efficient Bayesian inference with deep learning.
It provides users with:

- A user-friendly API for [amortized Bayesian workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07098)
- A rich collection of generative models, [from diffusion to consistency models](https://bayesflow-org.github.io/diffusion-experiments/)
- Multi-backend support via [Keras3](https://keras.io/keras_3/): You can use [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), or [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)

## Conceptual Overview

  <img alt="Overview graphic on using BayesFlow. It is split in three columns: 1. Simulate: generate data from any simulation you like. 2. Amortize: use BayesFlow to define your neural estimator with any deep learning backend you choose, as it is part of the Keras ecosystem. 3. Learn: with powerful generative AI and robust diagnostic features, BayesFlow is the gold-standard toolkit for simulation intelligence." src="./img/bf_landing_light.png">

With BayesFlow, you can easily train neural networks for tasks like parameter estimation, model comparison, and validation. It works for both complex simulators that cannot be expressed as parametric models (i.e., simulation-based inference) as well as traditional statistical models. BayesFlow provides a streamlined workflow layer for inference, especially in situations where conventional methods are unavailable or inefficient.

## Install

We currently support Python 3.11 to 3.13. You can install the latest stable version from PyPI using:

```bash
pip install "bayesflow>=2.0"
```

If you want the latest features, you can install from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bayesflow-org/bayesflow.git@dev
```

If you encounter problems with this or require more control, please refer to the instructions to install from source below.

### Backend

To use BayesFlow, you will also need to install one of the following machine learning backends.
Note that BayesFlow **will not run** without a backend.

- [Install JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
- [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [Install TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)

If you don't know which backend to use, we recommend JAX as it is currently the fastest backend.

As of version ``2.0.7``, the backend will be set automatically. If you have multiple backends, you can manually [set the backend environment variable as described by keras](https://keras.io/getting_started/#configuring-your-backend).
For example, inside your Python script write:

```python
import os
os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "jax"
import bayesflow
```

If you use conda, you can alternatively set this individually for each environment in your terminal. For example:

```bash
conda env config vars set KERAS_BACKEND=jax
```

Or just plainly set the environment variable in your shell:

```bash
export KERAS_BACKEND=jax
```

## Getting Started

Using the high-level interface is easy, as demonstrated by the minimal working example below:

```python
import bayesflow as bf

workflow = bf.BasicWorkflow(
    inference_network=bf.networks.FlowMatching(),
    inference_variables=["parameters"],
    inference_conditions=["observables"],
    simulator=bf.simulators.SIR()
)

history = workflow.fit_online(epochs=20, batch_size=32, num_batches_per_epoch=200)

diagnostics = workflow.plot_default_diagnostics(test_data=300)
```

## Citing BayesFlow

If you are using the new multi-backend version of BayesFlow, we recommend citing our new [software paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07098) (Kühmichel et al., 2026). For uses of the [legacy version](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05702), you can still reference Radev et al., (2023).

## FAQ

-------------

**Question:**
I am starting with Bayesflow, which backend should I use?

**Answer:**
We recommend JAX as it is currently the fastest backend.

-------------

**Question:**
I am getting `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'` when I try to import BayesFlow.

**Answer:**
One of these applies:

- You want to use tensorflow as your backend, but you have not installed it.
See [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).

- You want to use a backend other than tensorflow, but have not set the environment variable correctly.
See [here](https://keras.io/getting_started/#configuring-your-backend).

- You have set the environment variable, but it is not being picked up by Python.
This can happen silently in some development environments (e.g., VSCode or PyCharm).
Try setting the backend as shown [here](https://keras.io/getting_started/#configuring-your-backend)
in your Python script via `os.environ`.

-------------

**Question:**
What is the difference between Bayesflow 2 and previous versions?

**Answer:**
BayesFlow 2.0+ is a complete rewrite of the library. It shares the same overall goals with previous versions, but has much better modularity and extensibility. What is more, the new BayesFlow has multi-backend support via Keras3, while the old version was based on TensorFlow.
